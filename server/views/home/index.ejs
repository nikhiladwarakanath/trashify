    We are a bunch of environmentally concious students trying to do our part to reduce Global warming.
    <br>
    After analysing data and running prediction models on the same, we understood how huge a problem garbage is. Even though we can segragate waste as recyclable or not, it is still hard to actually recycle the waste.

    <br>
    Imagine, there are so many things which are a mixture of plastic, metal and stylafoam. It is hard to seperate one type of material from the other.

    <br>
    Mismanaged plastic and waste ultimately finds its way into ocean. I believe we have all seen the effects of that.

    <br>
    The least we can do to help, is to segregate waste at source. With the hope that such a statistic can be improved.

    <br>
    Kindly, use our app to help us facilitate the path for you.
