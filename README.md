# Trashify

Trashify is a platform which uses the user's input to display the closest trash disposal bins.
The main agenda with this platform was the bring awareness of a dire issue in modern times.
Waste disposal has become a huge menace to the environment.
The team behind Trashify plan to start with a small effort to contribute by creating awareness about the disposal bins in the city of New York.
The locations and information of the waste disposal bins are obtained from the Department of Sanitation of the City of New York.
